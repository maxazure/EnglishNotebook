    <string name="about_jared">Hi, I’m Jared, a TEFL-qualified English Teacher from Auckland, New Zealand! I’ve taught English for 3 years in primary schools, adult classes and private tutoring around the world - particularly to Spanish Speakers - and helped University students in Medellín, Colombia to prepare for their IELTS and graduation exams. My favorite thing to do is leave home with a pack on my back, hiking boots on my feet and without a clear destination. What\'s yours?</string>
